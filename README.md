# network-monitoring-project
 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on basic network security monitoring and traffic analysis. The goal is to understand how data flows across a network and how cybersecurity analysts can detect suspicious or abnormal activities using common tools.

This project simulates the role of an entry-level Security analyst  by capturing, analyzing, and documenting network traffic.


## Main Objectives
- Understand how network communication works
- Capture live network traffic
- Analyze TCP connections and packet behavior
- Identify basic scanning and reconnaissance activities
- Document findings 



## Tools Used
- Wireshark : for capturing and analyzing network packets
- Nmap :for network scanning and host discovery
-  Kali Linux : analysis environment and the Operating System
- GitHub : documentation and showcasing projects
-

# Methodology

### Step 1: Network Scanning
- Used Nmap to scan the local network
- Identified active hosts and open ports
- Observed common services running on the network

### Step 2: Traffic Capture
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark
- Applied filters to focus on TCP traffic
- Observed TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)

### Step 3: Packet Analysis
- Analyzed source and destination IP addresses
- Identified TCP SYN packets related to scanning activity
- Examined packet details such as flags, ports, and protocols

### Step 4: Documentation
- Took screenshots of packet captures
- Recorded observations and findings
- Documented the entire process in this repository

## Key Findings
- TCP SYN packets can indicate scanning or connection attempts
- Nmap scans generate identifiable traffic patterns
- Network monitoring helps detect reconnaissance activities early
- Proper filtering in Wireshark improves analysis efficiency
